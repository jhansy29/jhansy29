# 👋 Hey there, I'm Jhansy Harshitha Vankayalapati

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a graduate student pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Florida Atlantic University (FAU)** — expected to graduate in **December 2025** with a current **GPA of 3.96**. My academic and project journey has focused on making AI systems both practical and impactful — from LLM-powered bots to real-time data pipelines.
